Titanic Survival Prediction: A Machine Learning Pipelineüö¢ Project OverviewThis project is a classic machine learning exercise using the renowned Titanic dataset. The primary goal was to build and evaluate classification models to predict whether a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic based on their personal attributes.This notebook demonstrates the use of a modern, organized machine learning workflow, employing scikit-learn's Pipeline and ColumnTransformer functionality. As an aspiring AI/ML Engineer, my focus here was less on raw accuracy and more on building a robust, reusable, and clean structure for data preprocessing and model training.‚ú® Key Objectives and TechniquesEnd-to-End Pipeline: Implemented a single, cohesive Pipeline to handle all preprocessing (imputation, encoding, scaling) and modeling steps.ColumnTransformer: Used ColumnTransformer to apply different transformation steps to different columns (e.g., numerical vs. categorical features).Hyperparameter Optimization: Employed GridSearchCV combined with StratifiedKFold to systematically search for the best model parameters while maintaining a statistically sound cross-validation approach.Model Comparison: Evaluated two distinct models‚ÄîRandom Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression‚Äîto compare their performance and, crucially, interpret their underlying feature importance.üéØ Final ResultsAfter running the grid search and comparing the optimized Random Forest and Logistic Regression models, the best model achieved the following performance on the holdout test set:ModelTest Set AccuracyRandom Forest82.16%Logistic Regression81.67%üí° Insightful FindingWhile both models performed similarly, the feature importance (coefficients for Logistic Regression and feature importances for Random Forest) were vastly different. This highlights an important modeling principle: similar performance doesn't mean similar behavior. It suggests that a more detailed correlation analysis and potential feature engineering is needed to better understand the true predictive power of the underlying variables.‚öôÔ∏è How to Run This ProjectPrerequisitesYou need Python 3.8+ installed on your system.SetupClone the repository:git clone [YOUR_REPO_URL]
